      <p>Inspired by <i>How UK Media Cover Artificial Intelligence</i>, we are interested in mediatic discourses around facial recognition and CCTV surveillance. We include <i>state media</i>, ie. the major's Twitter account.</p>

      <p>Facial recognition is an element of a much longer list of technical
      specifications for the police cars. It's troubling that the press release
      makes no attempt to problematise facial recognition in any way.</p><br>

      <p>
      For some reason the new police cars are a recurring theme. It's always the same structure: </p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Opens with nationalistic performance</li>
        <li>The major, the security minister and someone else give a speech</li>
	<li>The new cars are paraded, the major and her entourage clap, there's blowing of trumpets</li>
      </ul>
      <br>

      <p>How to talk about these images? Some ideas:</p>
      <br>

      <ul>
        <li>For me it's troubling that her communications team doesn't mind veering into almost fascist imagery</li>
	<li>Are they reaching for the lowest common denominator?</li>
	<li>What are they trying to communicate?</li>
	<li>How self-aware are they about the images they are generating?</li>
      </ul>

        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/claudiashein/status/1181389144624418821">This</a> video from the major's Twitter reminds me of Donna Haraway's <i>Situated knowledges</i>: "Vision in this technological feast becomes unregulated gluttony; all seems not just mythically about the god trick of seeing everything from nowhere, but to have put the myth into ordinary practice." Beyond Haraway, note that the monitor seems to be playing VLC.</p>

      <p>In July and August, policemen were involved in the rape of 3 different women.</p><br>
      <p>Two demonstrations were organised. One of their slogans was <i>NoNosCuidanNosViolan ("They don’t protect us; they rape us.")</i></p><br>
      <p>During one of the demonstrations, the security minister was <i>glittered</i>, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/mexico-city-protest-police-rape-teenage-girls-demonstration-a9055641.html">https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/mexico-city-protest-police-rape-teenage-girls-demonstration-a9055641.html</a></p><br>
      <p>In my opinion, it's become difficult to talk about one of the cases. This case grew a lot.</p><br>

      <ol>
        <li>The woman's personal details were leaked to the media by a corrupt judiciary.</li>
	<li>Because of the leak, the woman choose to disengage herself from everything very early in the process</li>
	<li>In one of their news shows, the media included CCTV video related to the case, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urDfBRjV01U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urDfBRjV01U</a> <a href="https://streamable.com/sjvqu">https://streamable.com/sjvqu</a></li>

    <div class="step slide" data-x="8000" data-y="-1500">
      <p>The woman is not visible for most of the duration of the CCTV footage.</p><br>
      <p>In my opinion, the media are being cynical. First they open up to an <i>analytical-empirical mode of procedure</i>. Then they themselves dismantle this possibility with inconclusive CCTV footage.</p><br>
      <p>In this section of the TV show they also put forward the disingenuous proposition that they can be neutral when releasing the video. They explicitly say <i>"nosotros no vamos a sacar conclusiones" (we are not going to draw any conclusions)</i>. It could be argued that the release is a conclusion of sorts.</p><br>
      <p>In this case, the usage of CCTV video by the media is problematic. IMO they are exploiting the woman, and they are not making any positive contributions to public debate.</p>

      <p>His immediate verbal response to the glitter bomb included the phrase: <i>Nosotros vamos a garantizar la objectividad</i>, <a href="https://twitter.com/azucenau/status/1161019120147718146">https://twitter.com/azucenau/status/1161019120147718146</a>.</p><br>
      <p>For some reason, he seems unable to contextualise the demonstrations beyond this past summer.</p><br>
      <p>To paraphrase Habermas, he can't see beyond the objectivity of the <i>analytical-empirical modes of procedure</i> that he himself defines.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.animalpolitico.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WhatsApp-Image-2019-08-12-at-2.52.10-PM.jpeg">Some</a> of the graffitti from the demonstrations included the phrase <i>No somos estadísticas (We are not statistics)</i></p><br>

<p>It's hard to know what the writer's original intention was. I
speculate it could go in two directions:</p><br>

<ul>
<li>The writer is saying that there is a strong correlation between someone's gender and their becoming a crime statistic</li>
<li>An idea of statistics that maybe isn't so popular these days. Statistics as something non-dynamic that exists only in some dusty office and that no one thinks much about.</li>
</ul><br>

<p>I like the graffitti for re-appropiation in the context of AI,
big data, etc. In this context, I would see some resistance in
the writer saying that they're not being modelled by the
probabilistic, statistical methods of these technologies.</p>
